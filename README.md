# FinancialRegulation-Selenium-Csharp
A testing framework written by me from scratch.

Using the PageObjects design pattern, and selenium binding for C#.

It involved storing results in local DB, generating test xml files that are used during testing.
Also supports multy-regulation and multy-tenant testing.
